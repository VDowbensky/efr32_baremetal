 * Accelerator routines for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 
 *
 * The APIs in this module help take care of configuring the radio for BLE
 * operation and provide some additional helper routines necessary for
 * normal BLE send/receive that aren't available directly in RAIL. To initialize
 * the radio you will still have to call RAIL_RfInit(). However RAIL_ChannelConfig(),
 * and RAIL_RadioConfig() will be taken care of for you.
 *
 * To implement a standard BLE link layer you will also need to handle tight
 * turnaround times and send packets at specific instants. This can all be
 * managed through general RAIL functions like RAIL_ScheduleTx(),
 * RAIL_ScheduleRx(), and RAIL_SetStateTiming(). See the full RAIL API for more
 * useful functions.
 *
 * A simple example of how to setup your application to be in BLE mode is shown
 * below. Note that this will put the radio on the first advertising channel
 * with the advertising Access Address. In any full featured BLE application you
 * will need to use the RAIL_BLE_SetupChannelRadioParams() function to change
 * the sync word and other parameters as needed based on your connection.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * 
 * // Put the radio into receive on the first BLE advertising channel
 * int bleAdvertiseEnable(void)
 * {
 *   // Call the BLE initialization function to load the right radio config
 *   RAIL_BLE_Init();
 * 
 *   // Configure us for the first advertising channel (Physical: 0, Logical: 37)
 *   // The CRC init value and Access Address come from the BLE specification.
 *   RAIL_BLE_SetupChannelRadioParams(0x555555, 0x8E89BED6, 37, false);
 *   
 *   // Start receiving on this channel (Physical: 0, Logical: 37)
 *   RAIL_RxStart(0);
 *  }
