/**
 * @addtogroup Memory_Management
 * @brief Application callbacks to provide memory for RAIL actions.
 *
 * The RAIL library does not want to dictate how upper layers handle memory
 * allocation for packet receive data. At the same time we need to put the
 * packets somewhere to give them to the upper layers. To abstract this we
 * require the user application to implement the RAILCb_AllocateMemory(),
 * RAILCb_FreeMemory(), RAILCb_BeginWriteMemory(), and RAILCb_EndWriteMemory()
 * callbacks. These callbacks will be called from interrupt context to interact
 * with whatever memory allocation system your application uses.
 *
 * Memory will be allocated for receiving a packet whenever we think we need
 * it.  This depends on the chip you're using and possibly the size of your
 * maximum packet. We will never ask for more memory than `MAX_PACKET_SIZE +
 * sizeof(\ref RAIL_RxPacketInfo_t)` where MAX_PACKET_SIZE is the maximum
 * packet your PHY is configured to receive over the air. Once you give us the
 * handle to this memory it must stay valid until we tell you we are done with
 * it using the RAILCb_FreeMemory() callback. Generally this will happen
 * immediately after we call the RAILCb_RxPacketReceived() function with that
 * handle. RAIL has no concept of an invalid handle so we will attempt to use
 * whatever you pass to us. This means that you will still receive all
 * callbacks for invalid handles even if we are forced to drop receive packet
 * bytes because they don't fit anywhere.
 *
 * If the handle is invalid you must make sure your callbacks do not
 * crash and that RAILCb_BeginWriteMemory() returns a NULL pointer or 0 bytes
 * available so that we do not try to write to this memory. In this case, the
 * packet data will be dropped.
 *
 * To actually write data to the handle you provide us we need to convert it
 * into an actual memory pointer. We will do this each time we need to access
 * the memory by calling RAILCb_BeginWriteMemory(). This function must return
 * a pointer to the requested offset in the memory buffer allocated. If you are
 * using non-contiguous memory buffers you can also return the number of bytes
 * available before we need to re-request a pointer with a new offset. Once the
 * access is complete we will call RAILCb_EndWriteMemory() with information
 * about exactly how many bytes were written at the specified offset. After this
 * call we will always call RAILCb_BeginWriteMemory() again before trying to
 * write any more data. In the event that you receive an invalid handle these
 * APIs must return NULL or set available bytes to 0 so that we do not attempt
 * to write packet data to the buffer.
 *
 * This system is fairly flexible and can tie into many higher level memory
 * allocation APIs. A simple example using one static buffer for memory
 * allocation is shown below. You will probably want a more advanced system
 * that can handle receiving multiple packets simultaneously.

/******************************************************************************
 * Data Management
 *****************************************************************************/
/**
 * @addtogroup Data_Management
 * @brief Data management functions
 *
 * These functions allow the application to choose how data is presented to the
 * application. There are two methods for RAIL to provide data, in a packet
 * based method leveraging \ref Memory_Management callbacks or in a FIFO based
 * method which gives the application more granularity and responsibility in
 * managing transmit and receive data.
 *
 * The application can configure RAIL data mangement through RAIL_DataConfig();
 * this function allows the application to specify the type of radio data (\ref
 * RAIL_TxDataSource_t and \ref RAIL_RxDataSource_t) and the method of
 * interacting with this data (\ref RAIL_DataMethod_t). By default, RAIL
 * configures Tx and Rx both with packet data source and packet mode.
 *
 * In packet based data management:
 *   - Load transmit data with RAIL_TxDataLoad()
 *   - Received data is returned in RAILCb_RxPacketReceived()
 *   - Packet lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
 *   - \ref Memory_Management callbacks will fire to ask for pointers to store
 *     data
 *
 * In FIFO based data management:
 *   - Load transmit data with RAIL_WriteTxFifo()
 *   - Received data is retrieved through RAIL_ReadRxFifo()
 *   - Packet Lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
 *   - Set fifo thresholds through RAIL_SetTxFifoThreshold() and
 *     RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold() which fires RAILCb_RxFifoAlmostFull() and
 *     RAILCb_TxFifoAlmostEmpty().
 *   - Get fifo count information through RAIL_GetRxFifoBytesAvailable()
 *     and RAIL_GetTxFifoSpaceAvailable()
 *   - Reset fifos with RAIL_ResetFifo()
 *   - CRC Error acceptance is on by default
 *
 * Both transmit and receive fifos are the same size; when trying to determine
 * an appropriate threshold, the application can use
 * RAIL_GetTxFifoSpaceAvailable() to query the size of the fifo if it is empty
 * and use that as the size of the receive fifo as well.  The transmit fifo is edge
 * based where it only provides an interrupt once when the threshold is
 * crossed. The receive fifo is level based where the interrupt will constantly
 * pend if the threshold is exceeded. This normally means that inside
 * RAILCb_RxFifoAlmostFull(), the application should empty enough of the fifo
 * to go under the threshold. If the application wishes to defer reading the
 * fifo to main, it can disable the receive fifo threshold interrupt via
 * RAIL_DisableRxFifoThreshold(). The application can reenable the interrupt
 * via RAIL_EnableRxFifoThreshold().
 *
 * In fifo mode, the fifos can store multiple packets. Depending on traffic,
 * RAIL can receive multiple packets into the receive fifo before the
 * application gets around to reading out the received data from the fifo. If
 * appended info is enabled, make sure to read out the appended info with
 * RAIL_ReadRxFifoAppendedInfo() before attempting to read out the next packet.
 * If the application aborts during packet reception, appended info will not be
 * present in the receive fifo. If a frame error occurs in fifo mode, the
 * contents of the receive fifo is unreliable and should be flushed.
 *
 * When calling RAIL_DataConfig() for fifo mode, RAIL will set \ref
 * RAIL_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS. Otherwise for packet mode, RAIL will set \ref
 * RAIL_IGNORE_NO_ERRORS. It is highly suggested that the application maintains
 * \ref RAIL_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS in fifo mode if using hardware crc checking.
 *
 * While RAIL defaults to packet mode, the application can explicitly
 * initialize RAIL for packet mode in the following manner:
 * @code{.c}
 * static const RAIL_DataConfig_t railDataConfig = {
 *   .txSource = TX_PACKET_DATA,
 *   .rxSource = RX_PACKET_DATA,
 *   .txMethod = PACKET_MODE,
 *   .rxMethod = PACKET_MODE,
 * };
 *
 * status = RAIL_DataConfig(&railDataConfig);
 *
 * // Callbacks that occur in Packet Mode
 * void RAILCb_TxPacketSent(RAIL_TxPacketInfo_t *txPacketInfo);
 * void RAILCb_RxPacketReceived(void *rxPacketHandle);
 * void *RAILCb_AllocateMemory(uint32_t size);
 * void RAILCb_FreeMemory(void *handle);
 * void *RAILCb_BeginWriteMemory(void *handle,
 *                          uint32_t offset,
 *                          uint32_t *available);
 * void RAILCb_EndWriteMemory(void *handle, uint32_t offset, uint32_t size);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Initializing RAIL for Fifo Mode requires a few more function calls:
 * @code{.c}
 * static const RAIL_DataConfig_t railDataConfig = {
 *   .txSource = TX_PACKET_DATA,
 *   .rxSource = RX_PACKET_DATA,
 *   .txMethod = FIFO_MODE,
 *   .rxMethod = FIFO_MODE,
 * };
 *
 * status = RAIL_DataConfig(&railDataConfig);
 *
 * // Get the size of the fifos
 * // The transmit and receive fifos are the same size
 * uint16_t fifoSize = RAIL_GetTxFifoSpaceAvailable();
 *
 * // Set the transmit and receive fifo thresholds
 * // For this example, set the threshold in the middle of each fifo
 * RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold(fifoSize / 2);
 * RAIL_SetTxFifoThreshold(fifoSize / 2);
 *
 * //Callbacks that occur in Fifo mode
 * void RAILCb_TxPacketSent(RAIL_TxPacketInfo_t *txPacketInfo);
 * void RAILCb_RxPacketReceived(void *rxPacketHandle);
 * void RAILCb_TxFifoAlmostEmpty(uint16_t spaceAvailable);
 * void RAILCb_RxFifoAlmostFull(uint16_t bytesAvailable);
 * @endcode
 *
 * On receive, there are multiple data sources that an application can use that
 * are only compatible with the fifo method of data delivery. All that differs
 * from the fifo mode example above is the RAIL_DataConfig_t::rxSource setting.
 * IQ data samples are taken at the hardware's oversample rate and the amount
 * of data can easily overwhelm CPU processing time. The sample rate depends on
 * the chosen PHY as is determined by the data rate as well as the decimation
 * chain. It is <b>not</b> recommended to use the IQ data source with sample
 * rates above 300k samples/second as the CPU might not be able to keep up with
 * the data.  Depending on the application and needed CPU bandwidth, slower
 * data rates may be required.
 * @code{.c}
 * // IQ data is provided into the receive fifo
 * static const RAIL_DataConfig_t railDataConfig = {

 * Address Filtering (Rx)
 *****************************************************************************/
/**
 * @addtogroup Address_Filtering
 * @brief Configuration APIs for receive packet address filtering.
 *
 * The address filtering code examines the packet as follows.
 *
 * | `Bytes: 0 - 255` | `0 - 8`  | `0 - 255` | `0 - 8`  | `Variable` |
 * |:----------------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|:----------:|
 * | `Data0`          | `Field0` | `Data1`   | `Field1` | `Data2`    |
 *
 * In the above structure, anything listed as DataN is an optional section of
 * bytes that RAIL will not process for address filtering. The FieldN segments
 * reference the specific sections in the packet that will each be interpreted
 * as an address during address filtering. The application may submit up to four
 * addresses to attempt to match each field segment and each address may have a
 * size of up to 8 bytes. To setup
 * address filtering you must first configure where the addresses are in your
 * packet and how long they are. Next, you need to configure what combinations
 * of matches in Field0 and Field1 should constitute an address match. Lastly,
 * you need to enter addresses into the tables for each field and enable them.
 * The first two of these are part of the RAIL_AddrConfig_t structure while the
 * second part is configured at runtime using the RAIL_AddressFilterSetAddress()
 * API. A brief description of each of these configurations is listed below.
 *
 * For the first piece of configuration, the offsets and sizes of the fields are
 * assumed to be fixed for the RAIL address filter. To set them you must specify
 * arrays for these values in the sizes and offsets entries in the
 * RAIL_AddrConfig_t struct. A size of zero will indicate that a field is
 * disabled.  The start offset for a field is relative to the previous start
 * offset and if you're using FrameType decoding the first start offset is
 * relative to the end of the byte containing the frame type.
 *
 * Configuring which combinations of Field0 and Field1 constitute a match is the
 * most complex portion of the address filter. The easiest way to think about
 * this is with a truth table. If you consider each of the four possible address
 * entries in a field then you can have a match on any one of those or a match
 * for none of them. We can represent this as a 4 bit mask where a 1 indicates a
 * match and a 0 indicates no match. If we then show the Field0 match options as
 * rows and the Field1 options as columns we get a truth table like the one
 * shown below.
 *
 * |          | 0000 | 0001 | 0010 | 0100 | 1000 |
 * |----------|------|------|------|------|------|
 * | __0000__ | bit0 | bit1 | bit2 | bit3 | bit4 |
 * | __0001__ | bit5 | bit6 | bit7 | bit8 | bit9 |
 * | __0010__ | bit10| bit11| bit12| bit13| bit14|
 * | __0100__ | bit15| bit16| bit17| bit18| bit19|
 * | __1000__ | bit20| bit21| bit22| bit23| bit24|
 *
 * Since this is only 25 bits it can be represented in one 32bit integer where a
 * 1 indicates filter pass and a 0 indicates filter fail. This is the matchTable
 * parameter in the configuration struct and it is what's used during filtering.
 * For common simple configurations we provide two defines, the truth tables for
 * which are shown below. The first is \ref
 * ADDRCONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_SINGLE_FIELD and it can be used if you're only using
 * one address field (either field). If you're using two fields and want to
 * force in the same address entry in each field you can use second define: \ref
 * ADDRCONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_DOUBLE_FIELD. For more complex systems you'll have to
 * create a valid table on your own.
 *
 * @note Address filtering does not function properly with PHYs that use a data
 * rate greater than 500kbps. If you require this you must filter in software
 * for the time being.

 * Auto Acking
 *****************************************************************************/
/**
 * @addtogroup Auto_Ack
 * @brief APIs for configuring Auto-Ack functionality
 *
 * These APIs are used to configure the radio for auto acknowledgement
 * features.  Auto ack inherently changes how the underlying state machine
 * behaves so users should not modify RAIL_SetRxTransitions() and
 * RAIL_SetTxTransitions() while using auto ack features.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Go to RX after ack operation, 100 us idle->rx/tx,
 * // 192 us rx->tx/tx->rx, 1000 us ack timeout
 * RAIL_AutoAckConfig_t autoAckConfig = { RAIL_RF_STATE_RX, 100, 192, 1000};
 *
 * RAIL_Status_t status = RAIL_AutoAckConfig(&autoAckConfig);
 *
 * uint8_t ackPayload[] = {0x05, 0x02, 0x10, 0x00};
 * RAIL_AutoAckData_t ackData = {ackPayload, sizeof(ackPayload)};
 *
 * RAIL_Status_t status = RAIL_AutoAckLoadBuffer(&ackData);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The acknowledgement will transmit based on the frame format configured via
 * the Radio Configurator. For example, if the frame format is using a variable
 * length scheme, the ack will be sent according to that scheme. If a 10 byte
 * packet is loaded into the ack, but the variable length field of the ack
 * payload specifies a length of 5, only 5 bytes will transmit for the ack.
 * The converse is also true, if the frame length is configured to be a fixed
 * 10 byte packet but only 5 bytes are loaded into the ack buffer then a TX
 * underflow will occur during the ack transmit.
 *
 * When auto ack is enabled, the default operation is to transmit the ack after
 * a receive and wait for an ack after a transmit. After the ack operation
 * completes, the radio will transition to the configured defaultState. If
 * there is a desire to not auto acknowledge a series of packets after transmit
 * or receive, call RAIL_AutoAckTxPause() and RAIL_AutoAckRxPause(). When
 * auto acking is paused, after successfully receiving or transmitting a
 * packet, the radio will transition to the defaultState. To get out of a
 * paused state and resume auto acking, call RAIL_AutoAckTxResume() or
 * RAIL_AutoAckRxResume().
 *
 * Applications can cancel the transmission of an ack with
 * RAIL_AutoAckCancelAck(). Conversly, applications can control if a transmit
 * operation should wait for an ack after transmitting by using
 * RAIL_TxStartWithOptions() and populating the waitForAck field in
 * \ref RAIL_TxOptions_t.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * void RAILCb_RxPacketReceived(void *rxPacketHandle)
 * {
 *   RAIL_RxPacketInfo_t rxPacketInfo = (RAIL_RxPacketInfo_t)rxPacketHandle;
 *
 *   // If we have just received an ACK, don't respond with an ACK
 *   if (rxPacketInfo->dataPtr[2] == 0xF1)
 *   {
 *     RAIL_AutoAckCancelAck();
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * void transmitAndWaitForAck (void)
 * {
 *   RAIL_TxOptions_t txOption;
 *   txOption.waitForAck = true;
 *   RAIL_Status_t status = RAIL_TxStartWithOptions(0, &txOption, NULL, NULL);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the ack payload is dynamic, the application must call
 * RAIL_AutoAckLoadBuffer() with the appropriate ack payload after the
 * application processes the receive. RAIL can auto ack from the normal
 * transmit buffer if RAIL_AutoAckUseTxBuffer() is called before the radio
 * transmits the ack.  Make sure the transmit buffer contains data loaded by
 * RAIL_TxDataLoad().
 *
 * Standards based protocols that contain auto ack functionality are normally
 * configured in the protocol specific config function. For example,
 * RAIL_IEEE802154_Init() provides auto ack configuration parameters in \ref
 * RAIL_IEEE802154_Config_t and should only be configured through that
 * function. It is unadvised to call both RAIL_IEEE802154_Init() and
 * RAIL_AutoAckConfig(). However, ack modification functions are still valid to
 * use with protocol specific acks. To cancel a IEEE 802.15.4 ack transmit, use
 * RAIL_AutoAckCancelAck().
